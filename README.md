# FacialRecognition

The idea here is to identify the person in the Webcam which be ater extended for various purposes. For eg: identifing who all are available in teams/zoom meetings or who is coming in through the door.

What we need is just one clear photo and the precision of it surprises me.

The source of the pic can be really anything , even a database. For a small scale project like this , I have use a local folder with photos.
